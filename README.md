## Project Notes[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#project-notes)
<u>Goals</u>
* Our project uses "clean code." <i>Clean code</i> is code that is easy to understand and easy to change.
We did this by:
    * Using the same HTML template for each page.
    * Including descriptive code comments
    * Using the same stylesheet for each page.


<u>Challenges</u>
* Working with group members in other geographical locations and time zones always presents a challenge but our group worked through this by using Zoom meetings and texts.
* Trying to ensure all group members had the same amount of Git commits was a challenge. This is because some commits had many complex changes (thus fewer commits) versus a large number of commits with just a few changes (such as typo correction).
