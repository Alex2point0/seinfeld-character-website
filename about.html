                Seinfeld (/ˈsaɪnfɛld/; SYNE-feld) is an American television sitcom created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld. It aired on NBC from July 5, 1989, to May 14, 1998, over nine seasons and 180 episodes. It stars Seinfeld as a fictionalized version of himself and focuses on his personal life with three of his friends: best friend George Costanza, former girlfriend Elaine Benes, and his neighbor from across the hall, Cosmo Kramer. It is set mostly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City. It has been described as "a show about nothing", often focusing on the minutiae of daily life.

                The series was often described as "a show about nothing".  The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that. Doesn’t everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you’re going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show’s really about something. The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous. Much of the show's humor is based upon repeated use of irony, incongruity, and (oftentimes unfortunate) coincidences.
